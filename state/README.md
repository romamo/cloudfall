# State

This module is the declarative source of truth for Cloudfall: versioned JSON
Schemas and the YAML resources they validate — servers, host profiles,
projects, components, services, domains, logging stacks, and SSH public keys.

It must not contain credentials or execution logic. Secret values live in
environment files outside the config directory (generation from a central
secrets manager is on the [roadmap](../ROADMAP.md)); state stores references
only.

## v1 contract

Schemas live in `schemas/v1/` and use JSON Schema Draft 2020-12. Every resource
has an `apiVersion`, `kind`, strict `metadata.id`, and kind-specific `spec`.
Unknown properties are rejected.

The current contract includes `Server`, `HostProfile`, `Project`, `Component`,
`Domain`, `Service`, `SshPublicKey`, and `LoggingStack` desired-state
resources. A `Service` declares one infrastructure service (v1: PostgreSQL)
with a loopback-only bind, project-owned databases resolved to peer-auth
roles, and a scheduled dump-and-prune backup contract. A
`LoggingStack` pins the guarded parallel migration, backend and collector
placement, package versions, loopback listeners (including the Prometheus
metrics backend), mTLS paths, retention, and explicit journal/file sources;
collectors push host metrics through the same gateway. A `Domain` pins the proxy
and origin servers, public names, edge mode, TLS policy, configuration evidence
path, and end-to-end health contract. Public keys are non-secret and are
scoped to an environment; private keys never belong in state. A server profile
captures the required Debian/systemd baseline, software RAID level and
capacity, mounts, packages, required service and timer units, an optional
default-deny inbound firewall contract, and an explicit allowlist of
configuration files whose metadata or hash may be inspected.

`observed-server.schema.json` defines the normalized, read-only evidence emitted
by the engine. Observations are runtime evidence, not desired state, and belong
under ignored controller storage such as `tmp/observed/`. They include
structured NVMe SMART health when available, systemd timer states, the
managed nftables table as raw JSON evidence, and listening-socket evidence
used to prove declared services bind only to loopback; configuration
contents and credentials must never be written there.

`observed-domain.schema.json` validates controller-side DNS, edge, TLS, origin,
and public HTTP evidence. `deployment-receipt.schema.json` validates receipts
written only after an Ansible proxy run has applied and validated its final
configuration. `artifact.schema.json` validates build metadata for hashed
release tarballs, and `release-receipt.schema.json` validates receipts written
only after a component release has passed its health gate. Together with server observations, these inputs derive planned,
ready-to-deploy, deployed, configured, and healthy service states.

`examples/` contains a complete valid desired-state set. `tests/invalid/`
contains deliberately invalid desired state, while
`tests/observed/compliant/` contains validated audit fixtures.

Real fleet inventory belongs in a separate private state repository. Keep
examples and test fixtures synthetic; provider identifiers, network
allocations, and desired profiles for live hosts never belong here.
