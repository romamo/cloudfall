"""Collect read-only observations of the fleet the inventory describes.

The inspect role needs two things Ansible does not know: which hosts
Cloudfall observes, and the server type each one is held to. In a brownfield
repository neither belongs in the team's files, because both are derived
from what they already declare.

So the run takes their inventory as it is and adds one ephemeral overlay
source holding nothing but the ``cloudfall_servers`` group and those two
derived variables. Ansible merges sources, so connection settings, group
membership and every other variable still come from their inventory; the
overlay is regenerated per run and owns nothing. Removing Cloudfall leaves
their inventory exactly as it was.
