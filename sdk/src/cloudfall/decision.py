"""The gate and the record: what an agent proposed and who let it.

An operation from the catalog is not run because an agent decided to run
it. A `read` operation runs freely; a `mutating` one runs in check mode
first, and what the diff showed is recorded before anyone approves; a
`destructive` one always waits for a human. The gate lives here rather
than in the agent's instructions, because an agent can be talked out of
its instructions and cannot be talked out of a process.

What the record holds is the point of the product. A job history says a
job ran and a client's tool log says a tool was called. This says which
operation was proposed against which targets, which fleet evidence it was
based on, what check mode reported before anything changed, who approved
it, and what came of it.
