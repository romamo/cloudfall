"""Catalog of every command an agent may run in a project, by effect.

The catalog is the one place that says which commands change servers and
which do not. ``cloudfall init`` renders it into the project's ``AGENTS.md``
so an agent reads the same classification the CLI enforces, and the tests
check it against the argparse trees, so a command added to a parser
without a catalog entry fails the suite instead of going unclassified.
