# Changelog

Notable changes to Cloudfall. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) once the project reaches 1.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `cloudfall why` answers "why did the agent do that" from the decision
  records alone, for a host (`--host`), an operation (`--operation`) or a
  time window (`--since`, `--until`, ISO 8601 or a bare date), as JSON or
  as one HTML page (`--format html`). Each decision is told as what it was
  based on, what was proposed, what check mode showed, what gated it, who
  approved, what the run and the verify step did and how it ended, every
  sentence drawn from a field of the record. A decision is about a host
  when the record names it, as the target or in the per-host evidence of
  a stage; a group pattern is not expanded, because that would need an
  inventory the record does not depend on. The same question is the
  read-only `why` tool on `cloudfall-mcp --repository`
- Every JSON document `cloudfall` prints, results and errors alike, carries
  `meta.schema_version` (`MAJOR.MINOR` of the output contract, now `1.0`)
  and `meta.tool_version` (the installed package version), so an agent can
  tell when the output shape may have changed without a separate call.
  MINOR moves when a command gains a key, MAJOR when one is removed,
  renamed or changes meaning. `cloudfall --version` prints the same
  version as JSON and exits 0
- Every JSON document also carries a `warnings` list. A key is removed only
  after a release in which documents holding it warn `FIELD_DEPRECATED`
  with the replacement key and the schema version that drops it
- `cloudfall changelog [--since MAJOR.MINOR]` lists changes to the output
  contract, newest first: version, date, `breaking`, and the added,
  removed and changed keys
- `cloudfall --schema-version MAJOR <command>` pins the output contract: it
  fails with `invalid_argument` before the command runs when this build no
  longer writes that MAJOR, so a pinned caller stops at a breaking release
  instead of misreading it. `--version` and `changelog` report the current
  and minimum supported versions

## [0.5.1] — 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Decision records default to `decisions/` beside the operations rather
  than to `tmp/decisions`: the record is what a team keeps, and `tmp/` is
  what they throw away. The diffs and logs beside each record are raw
  Ansible output, so a repository that commits them wants `no_log` on the
  tasks that handle secrets

### Fixed

- A decision is `verified` only when its verify run changed nothing. A
  verify step that exits zero while changing a host found the fleet not as
  the run left it and converged it further, which verifies nothing, so it
  is recorded `failed`. Every approved decision now carries a `verdict`
  saying why it ended where it did
- A record cites its artifacts and its observation basis as the repository
  sees them rather than by absolute path, because a record is committed
  and one machine's home directory means nothing in anyone else's checkout

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-21

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-21

### Added

- Brownfield fleet reader: `cloudfall audit` and `cloudfall inventory show`
  read the fleet from the team's own Ansible inventory, with `--inventory`
  or from the inventory an `ansible.cfg` in the current directory names.
  Hosts, groups and connection settings come from Ansible; a `cloudfall`
  block per host, `cloudfall_defaults` per group and the
  `cloudfall_server_types` catalog carry what Ansible does not model. The
  documents are validated against the same schemas a project directory
  gets, so `PlatformInventory` and everything built on it is unchanged
- `cloudfall.ansible_api` is the only module that imports ansible-core. It
  reads in process and falls back to the `ansible-inventory` command,
  reporting which served the read
- `cloudfall observe` collects one read-only snapshot per server through
  the team's inventory plus an ephemeral overlay holding only the
  `cloudfall_servers` group and the two variables the inspect role cannot
  derive, so the audit loop closes without a Cloudfall project. Their own
  `ansible.cfg` keeps deciding how Ansible connects; only the roles path
  is forced. `--limit` takes an Ansible host pattern, which Ansible
  resolves, and the run is judged against the hosts it asked for
- `StateValidator.validate_documents` validates resource documents
  assembled in memory, with the schemas, reference checks and error codes
  documents on disk get
- The operations catalog: every playbook the team runs is declared in
  `operations/` with a risk level, a target scope, typed inputs,
  preconditions and a verify step, and `cloudfall operations list|show`
  reads it. A playbook nobody declared is not an operation
- The gate and the record: `cloudfall operations propose` runs an
  operation in check mode and records the operation, targets, inputs, the
  evidence it was based on and the diff by sha256;
  `cloudfall operations approve --yes` records the approver, runs it, runs
  the verify playbook and closes the record as executed, verified or
  failed; `cloudfall operations decisions` reads the trail without the
  catalog
- The agent surface: `cloudfall-mcp --repository` serves a brownfield
  repository, where the tool list is the catalog. Each declared operation
  is one tool carrying its risk as MCP annotations, calling it runs check
  mode and records a proposal, and no tool approves anything: that stays a
  command a person runs

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-20

### Removed

- `cloudfall init --rev` and `--source`, and the machinery behind them:
  `GitRevision`, `GitSourceUrl`, `GitPin`, `IndexPin`, `CheckoutState`, the
  checkout inspection, and the `project_revision_unresolved`,
  `project_revision_uncommitted` and `project_revision_unpublished` errors.
  Cloudfall is on PyPI, so a project pins a release and resolves it like any
  other dependency; `resolve_installed_version` replaces
  `resolve_installed_pin`, and the `init` envelope reports `version` rather
  than a `pin` object. To run an unreleased Cloudfall in a project, point the
  dependency at a checkout with uv's own `[tool.uv.sources]`

### Changed

- The quickstart and the Render migration guide install Cloudfall from the
  index rather than from git

## [0.2.1] — 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- `cloudfall init` works from a PyPI install. An install from the package
  index records no origin to read a commit from, so `init` failed with
  `project_revision_unresolved` on the first command a new user runs, and
  `--rev` only worked around it by writing a project that installed
  Cloudfall from git instead of from the index. A project now pins whatever
  ran `init`: `cloudfall==<version>` with no `[tool.uv.sources]` table for a
  released install, the commit and repository for a git or source install
- The project README links the secrets guide and the reference examples at
  the release tag when the pin is a released version, rather than at a
  commit the install does not know

### Changed

- `InitOptions` and the `cloudfall init` envelope carry one `pin` instead of
  a `revision` and a `source`: `{"kind": "index", "version": ...}` or
  `{"kind": "git", "revision": ..., "source": ...}`. `resolve_installed_pin`
  replaces `resolve_installed_revision`
- `--rev` documents that it pins a commit from `--source`, which is now the
  explicit alternative to the default rather than the only mechanism

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-20

### Added

- `cloudfall-mcp` exposes `add_ssh_key`, `add_server_type`, and `add_server`
  so an agent can declare the fleet without writing YAML by hand; each
  returns the `cloudfall add` envelope, writes into the project only, and
  re-validates it. `cloudfall init` stays CLI-only because the server runs
  inside an existing project (#3)
- `cloudfall init` lays out the secrets setup (`secrets/` and a `.sops.yaml`
  template), runs `git init` unless the directory already lies inside a
  repository, links the secrets guide and the reference examples at the
  pinned commit, and takes `--description` for an About section in the
  README and the `description` in `pyproject.toml`
- `cloudfall init` writes `AGENTS.md`, the operating contract for AI agents
  in the project: canonical invocation, every command sorted by effect with
  the gate each server-changing command demands, the output contract and
  exit codes, what may be read under `tmp/`, the secrets rule, and git
  discipline; plus a one-line `CLAUDE.md` pointing at it. The
  classification comes from the new `cloudfall.commands` catalog, which
  the tests check against both argparse trees (#2)
- `cloudfall init` from a source checkout refuses to pin `HEAD` when tracked
  files are modified (`project_revision_uncommitted`) or when `HEAD` is on
  no remote branch (`project_revision_unpublished`), so a project never pins
  a commit that is not the running code or that `uv sync` cannot fetch
- Fleet repositories consume Cloudfall as a package: the wheel bundles the
  v1 schema catalog and the Ansible engine, and every `--schemas` and
  `--engine` default resolves to the bundled copies (or to the source tree
  when run from a checkout), so no submodule or sibling checkout is needed
- `cloudfall-engine playbook run` executes a bundled playbook by name or a
  fleet playbook by path under the engine's Ansible configuration, with
  `--roles` directories searched before the bundled roles and `--check`,
  `--diff`, `--syntax-check`, `--limit`, `--tags`, and `--extra-vars`
  passed through; `cloudfall-engine playbook list` names the bundled ones
- Timer-driven restore drill: an optional `backup.restoreCheckOnCalendar`
  schedule installs an audited restore-check service and timer for
  PostgreSQL and Redis, so backup restorability is verified continuously
  (M10; proven live on 2026-09-11 together with alert delivery to an
  external destination)

### Changed

- `ansible-core` is a runtime dependency rather than a development one, so
  an installed `cloudfall` package can run its engine
- **Breaking: common-vocabulary rename across schemas, CLI, and layout.**
  Resource kinds `Project` → `Application` and `HostProfile` → `ServerType`
  (schema files renamed to match); the `Server` spec field `profile` →
  `serverType`; the `Component` spec field `project` → `application`; the
  top-level `state/` directory → `config/` with resource directories
  `projects/` → `applications/` and `host-profiles/` → `server-types/`;
  `cloudfall state validate` → `cloudfall config validate`; importer flag
  `--project` → `--application`; Python API `validate_state` →
  `validate_config`, `ValidatedState` → `ValidatedConfig`,
  `StateValidationError` → `ConfigValidationError`; Taskfile variable
  `STATE_DIR` → `CONFIG_DIR`; inventory payload key `hostProfiles` →
  `serverTypes` and observed-server key `profile` → `serverType`. Existing
  config directories must be migrated by renaming the directories and the
  `kind`/`profile`/`project` fields; no compatibility aliases are provided
- `cloudfall-mcp --help` now documents every option and the confirmation
  handshake
- README quickstart covers cloning, `uv sync`, and automatic Python 3.14
  provisioning; the Task prerequisite is documented with a direct `uv run`
  equivalent
- Roadmap gained a forward-looking M6 section (catalog breadth, Render API
  import, cutover generator, secrets v2, bare-metal provisioning, backup and
  restore operations, fleet observability)
- `cloudfall`, `cloudfall-engine`, and `cloudfall-mcp` match long options
  exactly and report usage errors as the JSON error envelope
  (`invalid_argument`, exit 2) instead of argparse prose; unrecognized
  options are named without their values
- **Breaking: `cloudfall deploy`, `rollback`, `restart`, and `data migrate`
  change servers only with `--yes`.** Without it they run every
  controller-side check (declared component or service, verified artifact,
  declared database, source URL file) and print a `status: plan` preview
  naming the target servers, exit `0`, matching `cloudfall migrate` and the
  MCP confirmation handshake; scripts and Taskfile targets must add `--yes`
- Runtime path options (`--output`, `--receipts`, `--inventory-file`,
  `--observed`, `--plan-file`, and the other evidence and receipt
  directories) on all three entry points, and the MCP tools' output and plan
  paths, refuse a relative path that climbs out of the project
  (`tmp/../../x`); a location outside the project must be given as an
  absolute path

### Fixed

- A guessed `--api-key` or `--source-url` no longer binds to
  `--api-key-file`/`--source-url-file` and echoes the secret in the
  resulting file-not-found error
- Malformed component, service, proposal, application, server, and release
  ids fail as `invalid_argument` before any work starts instead of crashing
  with a traceback on exit 1
- JSON documents are flushed as they are written, so `operator run
  --interval` under a pipe or journald delivers each pass instead of
  holding it in the buffer and losing it on termination
- A missing or unreadable gateway CA, certificate, or key reports
  `operator_gateway_material_invalid` instead of an uncaught traceback
- `cloudfall init` suggests `uv run cloudfall config validate` as the next
  step; the previous `config validate .` hint no longer parsed

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-08

First public milestone: the Render-to-Hetzner wedge proven live end to end
on disposable Hetzner Cloud Debian 13 servers (see
[`docs/proving-runs/`](docs/proving-runs/)).

### Added

- Declarative state module: versioned v1 JSON Schemas for `Server`,
  `HostProfile`, `Project`, `Component`, `Service`, `Domain`, `SshPublicKey`,
  and `LoggingStack`, plus observation, receipt, and artifact schemas
- `cloudfall` CLI and Python API: state validation, typed inventory,
  config-versus-observed drift audit with distinct exit codes, service
  lifecycle status, and the evidence-derived operations dashboard
  (static build and live `dashboard serve`)
- `cloudfall-engine`: deterministic Ansible inventory rendering and the
  artifact builder (git ref to hashed tarball with release metadata)
- Engine roles: Debian bootstrap, UTC time baseline, SSH access hardening,
  nftables default-deny firewall, unattended security upgrades, read-only
  inspection, PostgreSQL with peer-auth databases and backup timers,
  Nginx/TLS domain routes with Let's Encrypt issuance, and the guarded
  Loki/Grafana/Alloy logging stack over an mTLS gateway
- Health-gated deploy slice: digest-verified artifact transfer, symlink
  releases, automatic rollback on failed health checks, and release receipts
- `cloudfall import render`: `render.yaml` blueprint importer with a
  structured gap report (`IMPORT-REPORT.md`)
- `cloudfall data migrate`: guided managed-Postgres dump and restore with
  row-count verification and a `DataMigrationReceipt`
- `cloudfall migrate`: resumable end-to-end orchestrator with persisted step
  progress and a DNS-verification pause at the cutover moment
- `cloudfall-mcp`: seventeen annotated MCP tools; read-only evidence tools
  exposed freely, every server-changing tool gated behind a two-step
  confirmation handshake
