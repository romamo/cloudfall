# Neon migration guide

This guide walks a Neon-hosted PostgreSQL database onto one self-hosted
Debian server with Cloudfall. Unlike the [Render guide](render-migration-guide.md)
there is no blueprint to import: Neon hosts only your database, so the
config is written by hand and the migration is a guided dump-and-restore
with the same tooling the Render path uses.

What you get in exchange for Neon's console is the record. Cloudfall is
the operator's record for a fleet run by an AI agent: the migration ends
with a receipt whose per-table row counts are the proof it worked, every
backup afterwards writes a receipt and a timer-driven drill proves it
restorable, and the always-on operator watches the database with the
evidence attached to every decision. Managed PostgreSQL is mostly
insurance; this keeps the coverage and makes the proof yours.

> **Status:** the guided data migration (`cloudfall data migrate`) is
> proven live against an external managed PostgreSQL — dump, restore,
> per-table row-count verification, refusal guards, and a
> `DataMigrationReceipt` (see the
> [proving run](proving-runs/2026-09-08-guided-data-migration.md)). The
> source was Render; any reachable PostgreSQL URL, including Neon's,
> takes the same path.

## Name mapping

Neon and Cloudfall describe overlapping things with different words:

| Neon | Cloudfall |
|---|---|
| Application | `Service` of kind PostgreSQL on a declared server |
| Default branch | The declared databases of that service |
| Compute endpoint | The PostgreSQL systemd unit: always on, no cold starts |
| Connection pooler (built-in PgBouncer) | Not needed for a co-located app: peer-authenticated local socket, no passwords, no TLS in the middle |
| Scheduled backups | Declared `backup` block: `pg_dump` on a systemd timer with retention, plus the restore drill (`cloudfall backup verify`) |
| Point-in-time restore / history | Last-dump recovery today; continuous WAL archiving and PITR are roadmap M13 |
| Snapshots | Your provider's volume snapshots, taken outside Cloudfall |
| Autoscaling / scale-to-zero | Fixed server capacity: for an always-on workload this is what you were paying serverless prices for |
| Neon console | Local read-only operations dashboard (`task dashboard`) rendered from receipts and observations, and `cloudfall audit` |
| Operation history | Receipts: the data migration, every backup and restore drill, and every operator decision write a schema-validated record of what was seen, done and verified |
| Metrics page | Per-service exporters flowing through the mTLS gateway (declared `metrics` block) |

## What you give up

Be deliberate about these; nothing below fails loudly after cutover, it is
simply absent:

- **Copy-on-write branching** — no equivalent; scratch databases are
  created and seeded explicitly
- **Restore to any second** — recovery granularity is the backup timer
  until M13 lands WAL archiving; if last-dump recovery is not acceptable,
  wait for M13 or archive WAL manually
- **Multi-node failover** — single host until the demand-gated M14
  formation; failover is manual by design today (see
  [ARCHITECTURE](../ARCHITECTURE.md))

## What you need

- A Debian 13 server already converged through baseline and services
  (a Hetzner Cloud VPS is the proven reference), or a fresh one plus an
  hour to get there
- The Neon application's connection details and console access
- Python 3.14 and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on the machine you
  run Cloudfall from

## Step 1: declare the PostgreSQL service

One `Service` resource, with the major version matching Neon's (the Neon
console shows it under application settings):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: cloudfall/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  id: postgresql-main
  description: Primary PostgreSQL, migrated from Neon
spec:
  serviceKind: postgresql
  environment: production
  server: h1
  bind:
    address: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5432
  postgresql:
    majorVersion: "17"
    databases:
      - name: app
        application: app
  backup:
    directory: /var/backups/cloudfall/postgresql-main
    onCalendar: "*-*-* 02:00:00 UTC"
    retentionDays: 14
  metrics:
    enabled: true
```

Declare one entry under `databases` per Neon database you are keeping.
Validate, preview, then converge:

```console
uv run cloudfall config validate
task services:deploy:check
task services:deploy
```

The check run is the preview step: it shows what would change on the host
and changes nothing. Both tasks are thin wrappers over
`cloudfall-engine playbook run services`; copy the command from
[`Taskfile.yml`](../Taskfile.yml) if you prefer not to install Task.

## Step 2: pre-flight checks on the Neon side

Run these against the Neon database before dumping; each is a cheap query
now versus a surprise after cutover:

- **Extensions** — `SELECT extname FROM pg_extension;` — everything
  listed must exist on Debian (`postgresql-contrib` covers the common
  ones; anything Neon-specific such as `pg_tiktoken` or `neon` does not
  carry and must be dropped or replaced first)
- **Version** — `SHOW server_version;` must match the declared
  `majorVersion` at the major level
- **Branches** — only the branch you dump from migrates; anything
  worth keeping on another branch is a separate database to declare and
  migrate, everything else dies with the application
- **Size** — `SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()));`
  to estimate the write-freeze window; dump plus restore for a
  10–20 GB database is minutes, not hours

## Step 3: stage the source URL

Use the **direct** (unpooled) connection string, not the `-pooler`
endpoint: `pg_dump` holds a session the transaction-mode pooler cannot
serve. In the Neon console this is the connection string with pooling
toggled off. Keep `sslmode=require`. If the compute is suspended, any
connection wakes it.

The URL goes into a controller-side file whose only content is the URL;
it is staged root-only on the target and removed afterwards, and it never
enters the config:

```console
printf '%s\n' 'postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/app?sslmode=require' \
  > tmp/neon-app-url
chmod 600 tmp/neon-app-url
```

## Step 4: freeze writes and migrate the data

The dump is a consistent MVCC snapshot, but writes that land on Neon
after the dump starts are lost. Put the application into maintenance
mode or stop its writers, then:

```console
uv run cloudfall data migrate postgresql-main \
  --database app --source-url-file tmp/neon-app-url
uv run cloudfall data migrate postgresql-main \
  --database app --source-url-file tmp/neon-app-url --yes
```

The first command checks the declared database and the URL file and shows
the plan; `--yes` runs it.

The guided migration dumps from Neon on the target host, restores over
the peer-authenticated socket as the declared owner, verifies per-table
row counts match the source exactly, removes the staged URL file and the
dump, and writes a `DataMigrationReceipt` with per-table counts. It
refuses non-empty target databases, so a re-run requires deliberately
dropping what was restored.

The row-count check is the verify step and the receipt is the record's
entry for the migration. The restore is not done because `pg_restore`
exited zero; it is done because every table's count matches, and the
receipt is what you show when asked whether anything was lost. An agent
driving this through `cloudfall-mcp` gets the same receipt and the same
refusal guards, and cannot skip either.

One database at a time; repeat per declared database. If the application
is also moving in the same operation, `cloudfall migrate --data
app=tmp/neon-app-url` inserts this step into the orchestrated plan
between services and deploys.

Note the one-time egress: Neon meters the dump like any other transfer,
so a 14 GB dump costs about a dollar — the last transfer bill this
database will produce.

## Step 5: cut over the application

Point the application's `DATABASE_URL` at the migrated database. For a
co-located app this is the local peer-authenticated socket URL (no
password, no TLS, no pooler); for an app elsewhere, route it the same
way as any other declared service. Deploy, watch health, and keep writes
frozen until the app is verified against the new database.

## Step 6: wind down Neon

- Keep the Neon application **paused, not deleted**, for a rollback window
  (a week is plenty); scale-to-zero makes waiting nearly free
- Verify the first scheduled backup ran and run the restore drill:
  `cloudfall backup run` / `cloudfall backup verify` — the point of
  leaving a managed provider is that restorability is now your receipt
  to hold, and the drill runs on a timer afterwards so it stays held
- Then delete the Neon application; billing stops with it

## After the migration

- `task audit` proves the server matches the config, with distinct exit
  codes for drift
- The declared alert rules (a `postgresql-down` example ships in
  `config/examples/alert-rules/`) put the database under the always-on
  operator: a firing alert becomes a proposal with the evidence attached,
  runs after approval or under a declared policy, and is verified by the
  alert stopping; see the [operator guide](operator-guide.md)
- The backup timer, restore drill, and `BackupReceipt` replace Neon's
  managed backups; PITR arrives with roadmap M13 and a standby with the
  demand-gated M14

What you hold at the end is not just a database on your own server but
its record: the migration receipt, every backup and drill receipt, and
every operator decision about it. That is what answers "is it safe" and
"why did the agent do that" without anyone remembering.
