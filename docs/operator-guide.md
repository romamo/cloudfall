# Operator guide

The operator is the always-on half of Cloudfall and the part that writes
the record: a management-host process that watches declared alerts and
audited drift, writes evidence-backed remediation proposals, executes them
only after an approval it does not grant itself, and verifies the result
before calling it done. It is deliberately deterministic — it never invents
actions, only maps declared triggers onto the engine entry points you
already use. The deciding is left to you or to your agent; the operator's
job is that every decision is gated, verified and on the record.

## Prerequisites

- A deployed logging stack with an `alerting` block (see the
  [logging service guide](logging-service-guide.md)) and at least one
  declared `AlertRule`
- The gateway's read-only alerts route, included automatically when the
  backend role runs: `GET /api/v1/alerts` over the same mTLS gateway that
  receives logs and metrics
- A client certificate for the management host, signed by the same CA that
  validates collector certificates (`collectors.clientTls`); the operator is
  just another mTLS client of the gateway

## Watching

One pass (fetch alerts, propose, exit):

```sh
uv run cloudfall operator run \
  --gateway-ca certs/ca.crt \
  --gateway-cert certs/operator.crt \
  --gateway-key certs/operator.key
```

Always-on with audited drift checks every 15 minutes:

```sh
uv run cloudfall operator run \
  --gateway-ca certs/ca.crt \
  --gateway-cert certs/operator.crt \
  --gateway-key certs/operator.key \
  --interval 30 --drift-interval 900
```

The alerts endpoint is derived from the declared gateway
(`https://<serverName>:<port>/api/v1/alerts`); pass `--gateway-url` to
override. Drift checks run the read-only `inspect.yml` playbook, refresh
observations under `--observed`, and audit them; drifted checks become
proposals split by remediation: service checks propose `services.yml`,
everything else proposes `baseline.yml`.

Every proposal is a schema-validated receipt in `--proposals`
(default `tmp/operator/proposals`): the trigger evidence (alert labels or
drifted checks), a diagnosis, the exact operation, and later its outcome.
An open or failed proposal blocks duplicates for the same trigger — a
failed remediation deliberately stays visible until a human looks at it.

## The record

The proposal store is the audit log. Each receipt answers "why did the
operator do that" without anyone writing a note:

- **What it saw**: the alert labels or the drifted checks that triggered it
- **What it proposed**: the diagnosis and the exact engine operation
- **Who approved**: a human through `operator approve`, an agent through
  the MCP confirm handshake, or a declared `OperatorPolicy`
  (`approval.mode: autonomous` with the policy id)
- **What happened**: `verified` or `failed`, with timestamps, from the
  verify step below, never from the playbook's exit code

`operator list` and `operator show` read the record; the dashboard renders
it. Autonomy in the next section is computed from it. The
[brownfield design](brownfield-design.md) generalises this entry to every
declared operation as a decision record with the fleet snapshot and the
check-mode diff, and `cloudfall why` queries those records by host,
operation or time window. The operator's receipts here are the older
form of the same entry and are not yet read by `cloudfall why`.

To run persistently, wrap the command in a systemd service on the
management host:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Cloudfall operator (propose mode)
After=network-online.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/opt/my-project
Environment=CLOUDFALL_PROJECT=/opt/my-project
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/uv run cloudfall operator run \
  --gateway-ca certs/ca.crt --gateway-cert certs/operator.crt \
  --gateway-key certs/operator.key --interval 30 --drift-interval 900
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Reviewing and approving

```sh
uv run cloudfall operator list
uv run cloudfall operator show op-20260910t150000-abcdef1234567890
uv run cloudfall operator approve op-... \
  --gateway-ca certs/ca.crt --gateway-cert certs/operator.crt \
  --gateway-key certs/operator.key
```

Approval executes the proposal's engine playbook and then verifies the
trigger actually resolved: an alert-triggered proposal must see its alert
stop firing, a drift-triggered proposal must see its drifted checks audit
compliant again (`--verify-timeout`, default 180 s). The receipt records
`verified` or `failed` with timestamps either way — the operator never
reports success it cannot prove. A playbook that ran is not an outcome; the
verify step is. Gateway TLS flags are only needed when approving
alert-triggered proposals; drift approvals verify through the audit.

## Graduated autonomy

Declaring an `OperatorPolicy` licenses the daemon to execute routine
proposals without asking — that declaration *is* the consent, and its
absence means propose-only forever:

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudfall/v1
kind: OperatorPolicy
metadata:
  id: production-operator
spec:
  environment: production
  autonomy:
    operations:
      - kind: converge-services
        requiredVerifiedRuns: 3
      - kind: converge-baseline
        requiredVerifiedRuns: 5
    maxAutonomousPerHour: 4
    quietHours:
      start: "01:00"
      end: "05:00"
```

Autonomy is earned, bounded, and revocable:

- **Earned by receipts**: an operation kind executes autonomously only after
  `requiredVerifiedRuns` verified receipts for that kind exist in the
  proposal store — human-approved runs build the trust history
- **Suspended on failure**: if the most recent receipt for a kind failed,
  autonomy for that kind is withheld until a human-approved run verifies
  again
- **Rate-limited and time-bounded**: at most `maxAutonomousPerHour`
  autonomous executions, and none during declared quiet hours; withheld
  proposals stay open for normal human approval
- **Structurally confined**: the policy schema can only grant the
  convergence operations. DNS cutover, data deletion, and database
  promotion are not grantable — confirm forever, by construction

Every autonomous execution is receipted with `approval.mode: autonomous`
and the licensing policy's id, verified exactly like a human-approved run,
and visible in `operator list`. When a policy is declared, the running
daemon adds an autonomy pass after each watch pass and reports which
proposals it executed and which it withheld, with reasons.

## Through an agent

`cloudfall-mcp` exposes the same surface with the standard confirmation
handshake — start it with the gateway material to enable the watch tool:

```sh
uv run cloudfall-mcp \
  --gateway-ca certs/ca.crt --gateway-cert certs/operator.crt \
  --gateway-key certs/operator.key
```

- `operator_proposals` (read-only) — list receipts with trigger, diagnosis,
  and outcome
- `operator_watch` (read-only; `drift=true` adds an audited drift pass) —
  one watch pass
- `operator_approve` — previews the exact command and diagnosis, then
  requires `confirm=true` to execute and verify

The agent is the brain here and the operator is the record. The agent can
watch, read, relay the diagnosis and decide to approve; the tools are
annotated so the client gates the mutating one with its own permission
mode, and nothing mutates a server without the explicit confirm. Whichever
way a proposal is approved, the receipt is the same, so an agent-approved
remediation is as explainable afterwards as a human-approved one.
